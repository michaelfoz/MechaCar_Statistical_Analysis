#### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

#### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

#### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils (Deliverable 2: performed on Suspension_Coil.csv)

#### The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils (Deliverable 3: performed on Suspension_Coil.csv)

The image/screenshot below: t-test performed on all manufacturing lots (1-3).
